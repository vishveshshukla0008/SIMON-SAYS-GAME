# SIMON-SAYS-GAME
This project is a web-based "Simon" game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players repeat a sequence of flashing colored buttons, with difficulty increasing as levels progress. Features include level progression, high score tracking, and visual feedback. Players can restart after losing, and the highest score is saved. A fun memory challenge!
